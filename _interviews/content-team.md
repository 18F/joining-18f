Hi there: We’re glad to hear you’re interested in joining the 18F Content team! If our Talent Team forwards your résumé to us, you can expect to participate in four interviews:

* The initial phone screen: During this approximately 30-minute call, you’ll talk to a member of the content team about your interest in 18F, your past experience, and various other topics.

After an initial phone screen, you’ll complete the following interviews during one three-hour session. Each interview will be with a different 18F staffer, and each will last approximately one hour.

* The technical interview: The technical interview is your chance to discuss your past projects, areas of specialization, and what you’re seeking in a role with 18F.
* The problem-solving interview: Problem-solving prowess is central to our work, and during this interview you’ll show how you can think on your feet, defuse tense situations, and use previous experiences to inform future workflow.
* The core values interview: 18F is a great place to work — we say it loudly and we say it often. One reason for this is our collective support of certain core values. During this conversation, we’ll talk about the values that drive 18F and how your behavior and experience exemplify them.

As you’d expect, each interview is different. In general, though, we try to follow the formats described below. Sometimes, we’ll want to spend more time than usual talking about a series of blog posts you wrote, a homepage whose copy you redesigned, or your views on plain language. Other times, we might want to hear more about how you won over a particularly difficult stakeholder. In all cases, our goal is to get to know you as well as possible to ensure we’re a good fit for you (and you for us). Come prepared to discuss your past projects and how you see yourself figuring into our team.

### Technical interview format

* Introduction (~five minutes)
* Your experience — We’ll ask you about roles you’ve held and projects you’ve completed. We’ll also inquire about your content philosophy. (~30 minutes)
* Discussion of specific pieces — We’ll discuss, in more depth, selected pieces from your portfolio, and ask you to walk us through your generative and revision processes. (~10 minutes)
* Time for you to ask us questions (~15 minutes)

### Problem-solving interview format

* Introduction (~five minutes)
* Conflict resolution — We’ll ask you about how you’ve successfully navigated past conflicts, how you’ve used less-than-successful projects to inform your workflow, and where you see opportunities for growth. (~25 minutes)
* Hypotheticals — During the second part of the interview, your interviewer will introduce hypothetical situations and ask how you’d navigate them. Don’t worry — we won’t ask what part of a sandwich you’d choose to be, though we will ask some out-of-the-box questions. (~25 minutes)
* Time for you to ask us questions (~five minutes)

### Core values interview format

* Introduction (~five minutes)
* Why 18F? — This portion of the conversation will focus on why you want to work with us and touch on your previous civic oriented service. (~15 minutes)
* Collaborative experience — We’ll ask you to discuss your past work on teams, including shared processes, collaborative editing, working arrangements (distributed vs. onsite), and what you envision as an ideal team. (~15 minutes)
* Agile experience — Next, we’ll get to know more about your thoughts on working in an agile organization and creating user-centered content. (~15 minutes)
* Time for you to ask us questions (~10 minutes)
