There isn't one description that matches the role of all Product Leads at 18F. Ultimately, it depends on the nature of the relationship between 18F and a partner agency.  Some relationships have one account manager with multiple product managers who focus on building out separate products while others have one person who is an Account Manager/Product Manager hybrid. No matter where you fall on the spectrum between Account Manager, Product Manager (and both!), you'll have three interviews:

### Core Values Interview (1 hour)
We want to know about what you're passionate about, how you worked with teams in the past and why you think 18F is a good fit for you. We expect you to ask the same of us. 

### Problem Solving Interview (1 hour)
We'll present you with hypothetical problems and actual problems that we've faced to see how you would handle them. We’re also very curious about your response to problems that you’ve faced in your experience.

### Technical Interview (1 hour)
This is where we dive deep into the process, methodologies and tools that you use to get the job done and your beliefs on how teams should work together.
