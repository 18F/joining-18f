If you are scheduled to interview with the Product Team, you'll talk with three members of our team for an hour each. Each interview will focus on one of the areas below and will include time for you to ask your interviewer questions as well.  

### Product Development (one hour)
Come prepared to talk about products you've managed, the challenges you faced, and how and why you made the choices you did.  We'll also discuss common scenarios our product managers face, and how you might approach them.

### Team Leadership (one hour)
We'll ask you about your experience leading teams and leadership roles you've held.  We're most interested in your experience leading delivery teams, especially using agile methods. 

### Relationship Management and Core Values (one hour)
