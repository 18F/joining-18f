If you're a software developer applying to our engineering team, you'll have two interviews: a technical interview and a core values interview. Although each interview is different, we generally follow the format outlined below. Sometimes we find one aspect of a candidate's work particularly fascinating, and we'll want to spend more time talking about it. For example, we might be having a really nice discussion on architecture that we don't want to end. Come prepared to discuss previous software you've built, why you architected it the way that you did, and what you learned from it.

### Technical interview (90 minutes)
- An introduction  (~five minutes)
- Technical questions about your previous work and experience that can be answered and discussed without coding on a whiteboard (no brainteasers)  (~20 minutes)
- Code reviewing a piece of preselected code  (15-20 minutes) 
- A highly coached “think out loud” code writing or system diagramming session. This could include writing or discussing a short function or adding a small feature to an existing piece of code (30-40 minutes)
- Time for you to ask questions of us (~15 minutes)

### Core values interview (90 minutes)

This interview can be more of a free form discussion, but it should drive at the qualifications described in the core values section below. 

 - Introductions (~five minutes)
 - Why you want to work here, previous civic oriented service (~15 minutes)
 - Discussion of past work in teams, including the processes, locations (remote vs on site), and how you'd like to work in the future (~15 minutes)
 - Discussion of previous work or thoughts and feelings about open source software, developing for the user, and agile and iterative development (~25 minutes)
 - Discussion of how you've handled previous conflict, past failures and successes, and where you see opportunities for growth (~20 minutes)
