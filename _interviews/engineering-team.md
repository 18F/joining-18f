If you're a software developer applying to our engineering team, you'll have two interviews: a technical interview and a core values interview. Although each interview is different, we generally follow the format outlined below. Sometimes we find one aspect of a candidate's work particularly fascinating, and we want to spend more time talking about it. For example, we may have a nice discussion on architecture that we don't want to end. Come prepared to discuss previous software you've built, why you architected it the way that you did, and what you learned from it.

### Technical interview format
- An introduction  (~five minutes)
- Technical questions about the candidate’s previous work and experience that can be answered and discussed without coding on a whiteboard (no brainteasers)  (~20 minutes)
- Code reviewing a piece of preselected code  (~15-20 minutes) 
- A highly coached “think out loud” code writing or system diagramming session. This could include writing or discussing a short function or adding a small feature to an existing piece of code (~30-40 minutes)
- Time for the candidate to ask questions of us (~15 minutes)

### Core values interview format 

This interview can be a little more of a free form discussion, but it should drive at the qualifications described in the core values section below. 

 - Introductions (~five minutes)
 - Why the candidate wants to work at 18F, previous civic oriented service (~15 minutes)
 - Discussion of past work in teams, including the processes, locations (remote vs on site), and how they would like to work in the future (~15 minutes)
 - Discussion of previous work or thoughts and feelings about open source software, agile/iterative development, developing for the user (~25 minutes)
 - Discussion of how the candidate has handled previous conflict, past failures and successes, and where they see opportunities for growth (~20 minutes)
