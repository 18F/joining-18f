We collect information and work directly with regulated industries. We are looking for a technical lead to bridge the gap between the evolving states of technology within the federal government. 

We are looking for an IT Solutions Architect to help us modernize the Engines and Vehicles Compliance Information System (EV-CIS) which has over 19,000 registered users from 13 industries and 38 countries and many stakeholders and partners including engine and vehicle manufacturers, external federal/state agencies such as DOE, DOT (co-regulators), Treasury, DHS and the California Air Resource Board (co-regulator).

You will provide solutions architecture and technical leadership using your familiarity with HTML, Java (or other object-oriented coding) and Oracle database experience to assist in moving the EPA to a more user-centric, modular approach to systems development.

Your challenge is to help the EV-CIS program to transition from legacy technology stacks to more modern technologies.

- Manage the development of  EV-CIS with an API first mindset using reusable components and operational strategies leveraging cloud services to support scalability, availability, performance, monitoring, backup, etc, to improve the security, resiliency, and agility of infrastructure and applications
- Ensure strategic alignment of technical design/architecture to meet business growth and direction
- Drive planning and delivery by utilizing agile tools such as product roadmaps, backlogs, measurable success criteria, and write user stories

**You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices through teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing.**
