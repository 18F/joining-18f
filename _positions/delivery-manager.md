Experience setting up teams for successful delivery by removing
obstacles (or blockers to progress), constantly helping the team to
become more self-organizing, and enabling the work the team does rather
than impose how itâ€™s done.

Manages one or more agile projects, typically to deliver a specific
product or transformation via a multi-disciplinary, high-skilled digital
team. Adept at delivering complex digital projects, breaking down
barriers to the team, and both planning at a higher level and getting
into the detail to make things happen when needed.

Defines project needs and feeds these into the portfolio/program process
to enable resources to be appropriately allocated.

Primarily responsible for:

-   Delivering projects and products using the appropriate agile project
management methodology, learning & iterating frequently

-   Working with the Product Manager to define the roadmap for any given
product and translating this into user stories

-   Leading the collaborative, dynamic planning process -- prioritizing
the work that needs to be done against the capacity and capability
of the team

-   Matrix-managing a multi-disciplinary team

-   Ensuring all products are built to an appropriate level of quality
for the stage (alpha/beta/production)

-   Actively and openly sharing knowledge of best practices
