###Role Summary
Using modern, open source web frameworks and tools, our developers (front end, back end and full-stack) work in small, cross-functional teams to produce functional, scalable products and services.

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will contribute high-quality, well-tested, maintainable code across an entire project lifecycle, using modern software development best practices.**

- Practice and enthusiastically share agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.
- Use usability research, analytics, and other metrics to influence project planning and design.
- Participate in code review, architecture discussions, and feature prioritization.
- Take pride of ownership in all projects you touch, leaving code better than you found it; contribute to documentation, tests, style fixes, accessibility, performance, and more.
- Deliver projects that are easy to deploy, update, and monitor by ensuring the necessary tooling is present early in the project development cycle.

**Objective #2: You will be active in the development of the engineering team members and culture through high levels of empathy, communication, and collaboration.**

- Work with other members of the distributed team to identify and solve complex technical, cultural, and organizational issues.
- Use past experience and knowledge to mentor (and learn from) your peers within 18F and throughout the federal government around software engineering best practices.
- Contribute to and maintain a positive team culture based on mutual communication, constructive criticism, and knowledge sharing.
- Participate in working groups or guilds focused on shaping engineering policy and practices such as front end development, documentation, and testing.
- Take pride in your teams: Push yourself and others to constantly be improving in technical ability, process, and knowledge.
- Work toward creating (and always improving) a culture of openness, transparency, and mutual assistance within the engineering team, 18F, and the federal government as a whole.

**Objective #3: You will act as an agent of culture change.**

- Participate in or lead (as necessary) an open dialogue with representatives from our partner agencies in implementing modern development standards, including transparency, user-centered design, and agile methodologies; understand and communicate the "why" of these standards, not just the "what."
- Demonstrate resilience in the face of bureaucracy: When faced with a hurdle, determine the root cause and address that in addition to the hurdle itself.
- Push the boundaries of what is possible within government while maintaining an understanding of the complexities of the organization; push back against the things that can be pushed back against and take a longer view for the things that can't.
