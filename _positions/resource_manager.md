As the Resource Manager for 18F Consulting, you’ll play the critically important role of ensuring all consultants are optimally utilized, and there is a sufficient mix and number consultants to meet the resource needs of current and upcoming projects. To be successful in this role, you must be able to master conflicting resource dynamics:

-   By law, the 18F Consulting business model must be 100 percent cost reimbursable, and cannot generate a profit. We generate revenue through the fees agency clients pay us. This means our consultants need to be working on client projects.

-   The more utilized our consultants are, the more efficiently we can recover our costs, which helps maintain a lower fee structure. Our people are not machines, however, and need to work at a sustainable pace.

-   We strive to maintain a portfolio of high-impact projects, but our consultants tend to derive higher levels of personal happiness by engaging in specific types of work (for example, healthcare, data mapping). You must understand what they prefer to work on and align them to that type of work, as best as possible.

-   We have multiple overlapping and highly fluid client engagements, with new ones starting and old ones finishing all the time. Some run as short as three days; others as long as six months. To complicate matters, resources are not fixed throughout an engagement; different resources are needed at different points in the project.

As you can see, this is a challenging role, but one that is essential to 18F Consulting’s financial and client project success.
You’ll need to work collaboratively with a number of stakeholders, including members of the 18F Consulting team (particularly [engagement managers](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/engagement-manager/) and [business development staff](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/positions/director-of-biz-dev-and-products/)) and the 18F Talent team, which manages 18F’s hiring operations.

## Key Objectives

Within the first 6-12 months after hiring, you’ll accomplish these objectives:

### Objective \#1: Design, implement, and operate a system for managing resource capacity and allocation in order to meet 18F Consulting’s financial obligations, client commitments, and individual preferences for certain types of project work.

### Objective \#2: Develop and maintain performance profiles (or position descriptions) for both standard and project-specific roles.

### Objective \#3: Develop a process for forecasting and fulfilling 18F Consulting’s resource needs through the 18F Talent team.
