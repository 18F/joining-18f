###Role Summary
The Director of Outreach creates and guides the strategy for all communications, website, social media, and event messaging to consistently articulate 18F’s mission. The director will work closely with a senior peer group as the communications partner, and with teammates across the organization, helping them effectively tell their stories and share key information with varied audiences. 

You’re a broad and strategic thinker who can see the interconnectivity between the types of work 18F’s teams do, with a strong track record as an implementer who can manage a variety of key initiatives. You’re an excellent writer and communicator with the skill to weave these separate narratives into a comprehensive, easy-to-follow, story that resonates with our stakeholders, partners, and the American public
