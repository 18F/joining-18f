##Role: Visual Designer

###Position Summary
Visual designers at 18F craft highly usable and beautiful web-based experiences for the benefit of the public. Because our clients are agencies of the U.S. government, our work should reflect and help preserve the integrity of our national image. Our visual designers must collaborate to establish and evolve design patterns which make our work consistent and efficient and can inform the design of websites for agencies who aren’t our clients. Additionally they should constantly push the boundaries and leverage the best and newest creative approaches and web technologies.

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will deliver a high-quality, user-centered web-design in an agile environment.**
- Successfully interpret critical notes from clients, design leaders, and team members.
- Create elegant, consistent, and usable designs which artfully translate wireframes into pixels, and offer front end developers friction-free implementation.
- Employ key design principles and master the requisite tools.
- Respectfully champion the cause of the user despite occasional stakeholder opposition.
- Foster cross-pollination with non-18F government designers.
- Create designs within the parameters of Section 508 to ensure accessibility for all projects.
- Tackle the job in front of you, regardless of whether it offers a significant opportunity for creative expression.
- Grow a consistent and beautiful body of work, which garners unsolicited praise from clients and users alike.

**Objective #2: You’ll maintain the 18F brand by implementing and expanding upon design patterns.**
- Utilize 18F’s set of design patterns including palettes, form components, and other re-usable elements.
- Identify inconsistent or less-than-successful elements of current conventions and modify them to improve their effectiveness and consistency with other 18F work.
- Regularly participate in group critiques, serving as both “critic” and the “critiqued.”
- Scour the web for applicable new design solutions and share findings with the team.
- Support the 18F brand by contributing to in-house projects.
