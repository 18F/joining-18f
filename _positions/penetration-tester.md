18F is looking for talented security engineers to join our team and help us build secure applications. This is a unique opportunity to help re-define how the government builds secure software. You’ll be a key contributor in helping to secure the tools and technology that the American people use to interact with the government. [18F is an open source team](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), so most of what you work on will be open source.

**This role is perfect for you if you love “breaking” systems to make them better.** You should be excited to get to find exploits in our software — and then work with us to fix them!
