###Role Summary
An 18F Product Lead is responsible for managing the development, delivery, and continuous improvement of products while establishing and managing our relationship with our partners (clients). As a product lead, you’ll work with the 18F intake team to evaluate potential work and communicate to potential clients, partner with the finance and contracts team to close deals, and work with cross-functional teams to deliver the right product in the right way.

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will assemble and lead a cross-functional team to deliver the right product for an agency partner client using agile-based methodologies.**

- Build meaningful relationships with clients and help them understand 18F’s user-centered, iterative approach to understanding the problem and building the solution.
- Determine the size, skills, and roles necessary for a team to deliver the solution for the client, and then help identify those team members.
- Use evidence (user research, analytics, and other metrics) to make product decisions, ask “why” a lot, and recognize the difference between “we can’t do that because of bureaucracy” and “we can’t do that because of the law.”
- Believe in and practice agile as a philosophy (not necessarily agile as a dogma), and apply user-centered design methods to ensure we’re building the right product.
- Manage QA and testing to make sure the team is building to the right level of quality; establish the bar for quality and the definition of done.
- Work with other teams at 18F, GSA, and partner organizations to ensure compliance with federal regulations such as Authority to Operate, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and Section 508.

**Objective #2: You will be the holder of the product vision, deftly managing client relationships and being the communication conduit to 18F team members to ensure alignment.**

- Establish a shared vision and understanding across the team; ensure all members of the 18F and client teams have a shared understanding of the project’s objectives and goals. 
- Navigate complex bureaucratic relationships to bring stakeholders together around a common goal.
- Make sure clients are fully engaged members of the team and help them manage expectations with their stakeholders.
- Give clients advice they need to hear instead of what they want to hear; promote best practices by making a strong case even in the face of resistance.
- Focus team efforts toward current goals and priorities.
- Revisit and revise project direction based on the outcome of experiments and user-based learning. 

**Objective #3: You will promote best practices, shared processes, and tools across all 18F product teams.**

- Reinforce 18F’s “way we work” values (building in the open, using open source, and so on.)
- Explore new tools and methodologies; share lessons with other product leads.
- Mentor others, give constructive criticism, and improve practices and standards on your teams.
- Actively engage with the team at large — take part in cross-project and cross-domain conversation, skill- and knowledge-sharing, and working groups or guilds.
