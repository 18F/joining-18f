###Objective #2:  You will contribute to the continued success of the content team and to team-wide content resources. 

- Participate in weekly group critiques and offer colleagues actionable insights.
- Identify systems or practices that are inconsistent or no longer serve the team and share findings with the content lead in an effort to improve team efficiency.
- Contribute to accessible content resources — tutorials, guides, and so on — that benefit the team as a whole.

- Help execute content-related events, including workshops, brown bags, hackathons, and more.
