## Management and organization structure

As a member of [18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/), you’ll
ultimately report to the Director of 18F Consulting. 18F Consulting
supports the mission and organizational priorities of 18F by working on
select, high-profile, high-impact projects.

We help the federal government better achieve its policy goals and serve
the American people by:

-   Helping agencies adopt human-centered design, agile, technology, open data, and acquisition practices.

-   Helping agencies maximize the value of every tax dollar spent on acquiring technology products and services.

-   Developing and delivering high-quality products and services, which originates from a strong understanding of the federal government's buying needs, challenges, and opportunities.

-   Helping agencies develop in-house capability to deliver high-quality digital services to their constituencies.

You’ll work as part of a cross-functional team of experienced designers,
product strategists, architects, engineers, data scientists, and
acquisition specialists.

You’ll work alongside the rest of 18F, which includes over 100 digital
specialists, along with major organizations across the government such
as the Office of Management and Budget’s U.S. Digital Service, the White
House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, U.S. Department of the
Treasury, Department of Labor, Department of Defense, and Department of
Veterans Affairs.

You’ll work on a number of different projects that support various
high-priority mission areas of the government.

## The way 18F Consulting collaborates

18F Consulting tries to create an environment where you *show, don’t
tell* and you *design with, not for*. We collaborate with people of
diverse talents. Some people understand the technology, others
understand design, and others are deep in the business or ways of
government with little knowledge of design and technology. The 18F
Consulting teams are flat, lean, and flexible, but our clients’ teams
are huge and hierarchical. There will be a lot of meetings, often with
dozens of people in them.

We collaborate constantly, bringing along our direct team, product
owners, designers, developers (including contractors), leadership, and
anyone else with a stake in the outcome with full transparency from
beginning to end.

We are most effective when we are embedded with our agency clients,
spending as much time as possible side-by-side with them. Much of our
time with clients is about understanding their needs and helping them
feel comfortable with more ambiguity and less certainty than they’re
used to about what the end product or outcome will be. When we leave
them, they should be confident that their organization can continue to
support modern design, development, and data management practices.

18F Consulting team members tend to be self-directed. We're expected to
always be productive and working on the most worthwhile projects.

## The challenges of being an 18F team member

The projects we work on are hugely important. Many of the people we
serve are on the edges of society or at risk: veterans with
service-related health issues; undocumented immigrants; the working
poor; people in heavy debt; children and adults in need of life skills
and education.

Working for these populations means we will launch some of the most
important projects since the New Deal. And if it goes well, we will get
little or no credit. The agencies we work with will be the heroes.

Things happen: states sue the federal government to stop programs;
Congress changes its mind; appropriation bills pass reallocating funds.
This means priorities can change quickly and projects can be halted in
midstream. You need to be comfortable with sudden change and ambiguity.
You need to react quickly and pick the next thing to tackle, when work
gets stuck by the machines of government.

Everything you do, say, write, and make is a public record. Anyone can
make a Freedom of Information Act request to see any record you’ve
created.
