The Director of Business Development and Products plays a critical role on the 18F Consulting team: you ensure that there is a healthy pipeline of meaningful, high-impact, cost-reimbursable work, and that the pre-sales stage is a delightful experience for our federal agency clients. This isn't about revenue for revenue's sake. By law, we're not allowed to generate a profit, but we must fully recover the costs of our resources through the fees agency clients pay us. Ultimately, we care most about the work we do for agencies and the constituencies they serve, but cost recovery is an important aspect of 18F’s existence and growth.

In addition to business development, you're responsible for treating 18F Consulting as a portfolio of products. That means understanding what our customers need, developing services and solutions to meet those needs, and marketing and selling these offerings to attract clients.

You will not be successful in this role working alone in an ivory tower. You must “get out of the building” and actively engage and listen to our prospective and current customers. You’ll also need to work collaboratively with other stakeholders, including members of your 18F Consulting team, 18F at large, the Chief Information Officer community, the White House, etc.

Success in this position does require a command of the digital landscape (for example, user-centered design, agile development). You need to understand how we work and why we work the way we do.

## Key Objectives

Within the first 6-12 months after hiring, you’ll accomplish these objectives:

### Manage the portfolio of 18F Consulting services and solutions

-   Continually understand the needs of our customers, identify market opportunities, and develop new or enhance existing offerings to meet those needs.

-   Develop and maintain assets (for example, sales sheets, case studies, statement of work templates, and standard engagement models) to support the marketing, sales, and delivery of our services and solutions.

### Generate qualified leads and manage the sales pipeline lifecycle

-   Perform strategic business development to generate qualified leads for 18F Consulting.

-   Ensure there is a sufficient pipeline of work in order to satisfy 18F Consulting’s 100 percent cost-reimbursement requirement.

-   Manage the 18F Consulting sales intake process in coordination with 18F’s central project intake team.

-   Understand the client projects in enough detail to articulate the nature of the work to members of your team and to prepare the necessary interagency agreement documentation (for example, pricing estimates and statements of work).

-   Refer work to other businesses within 18F and the General Services Administration that doesn’t fall within the scope of 18F Consulting’s business.
