##Role: Data Architect

###Role Summary
The federal government has hundreds of thousands of data sets, and managing that data is an extremely challenging task. As a data architect on the 18F Consulting team, you will help agencies liberate and embrace their data, equipping them with profound insights drawn from that data and empowering them to more effectively fulfill their mission. 18F Data Architects should not be theoreticians, but rather practitioners in the craft of data science. 18F Consulting team members need to be able to get hands on, when necessary, but we often help partner agencies capitalize on their existing tools and resources or work in tandem with government contractors. It’s imperative that our data architect is dedicated to results and has genuine passion about building a sustainable data infrastructure within government. We aspire to not only help our partners solve their problems efficiently and with the ability to scale, but also help them do it in an agile way. 

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will help partner agencies find and take care of the data sets that are in need of a little love.**

- Work on cross-functional teams to learn about agencies’ data needs within their existing systems.
- Conduct workshops with agencies to identify uses of and promote understanding of their data sets.  
- Write blog posts to describe your team’s best practices and what you’ve learned about data management. 

**Objective #2: You will find and create tools and resources to help partner agencies address their data management needs.** 

- Acquire broad knowledge of the landscape of past and present data management challenges that exist within government. 
- Uncover challenges shared across agencies, and work to create connections and facilitate cooperation.
- Recommend, based on each agency’s unique needs, existing data-management tools and resources. 
- Prototype tools and/or build infrastructure for agencies to use to manage their data.
  
**Objective #3: You will contribute to forming, assessing, and refining the methods the Consulting team uses to serve our clients.**

- Help curate our team’s internal data, focusing on how to collect, maintain, and publish it. 
- Use data to identify alternative methods of approaching and understanding our clients’ needs.
