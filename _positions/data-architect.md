“organization”: “18F Consulting”,

“position”: “Data Architect”,

“description”: “Let’s face it: the federal government has more data than
it knows what to do with. And for most government types, managing data
has been a challenge for resources and attention. The Data Architect
empathizes with this, and helps partner agencies liberate and embrace
their data and more effectively fulfill their missions through a deeper
understanding of the meaning of their data.

18F Data Architects should not be theoreticians, but practitioners.
Because of our business model, 18F Consulting does not always do the
work ourselves: we rely on existing tools, partner agencies’ resources,
government contractors, and others. We also can’t afford — in terms of
time, resources, or emotional energy — to work with agencies who are not
ready to do things the right way. The Data Architect therefore must be
focused on results and building a sustainable data infrastructure within
government.”
