### Role summary

Site Reliability Engineers ensure our platforms and infrastructure systems, as well as the applications on top of them, are reliable and easy to deploy and maintain. You’ll be involved in designing and implementing systems in a human-centered way, communicating with users, and finding solutions to help people work more smoothly. Along with providing the platform, you seek opportunities and get creative in architecting solutions.

### Key objectives
**Objective #1: Ensure the platforms are available, performant, and secure.** 

- Work with internal and external groups to integrate, configure, manage, and support production systems, including monitoring platform and application uptime and maximizing platform reliability.
- Identify important metrics for debugging platform problems.
- Monitor the availability of platforms.
- Respond to system alerts, troubleshoot system errors, and resolve incidents.
- Use and build tools to ensure easy deployment and upgrades of platforms and subsystems.
- Ensure infrastructure is used efficiently. 

**Objective #2: Automate platform operations using modern software development techniques such as agile processes, iterative development, and continuous improvement.**

- Treat configuration as code: manage, design, deploy, and test platform operations.
- Develop automation tools to eliminate manual tasks, reduce errors, and increase the team’s productivity.
- Deploy software in a repeatable and documented way; document specifications, process, systems, and procedures.
- Take an iterative approach to identifying and removing single points of failure.

**Objective #3: Take a user-centered approach to building tools.**
- Help reduce the security and compliance burden on users.
- Support and empathize with development teams by working closely with them to manage system lifecycles, including change and configuration management.
- Create tooling to reduce developer workload in deploying and managing their applications.
- Evangelize the importance of the platform.
