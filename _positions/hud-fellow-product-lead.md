- Build meaningful relationships with partners at HUD and help them understand user-centered, iterative approach to understanding the problem and building the solution

- Believe in and practice agile as a philosophy, not necessarily agile as a dogma, and apply user-centered design methods to ensure the right product is built
- Manage QA and testing to make sure the team is building to the right level of quality. Establish the bar for quality and the definition of done

**You will be the holder of the product vision, deftly managing relationships and being the communication to ensure alignment.**

- Establish a shared vision and understanding across the team. Ensure all members of the immediate and broader teams have a shared understanding of the project’s objectives and goals
- Navigate complex bureaucratic relationships to bring stakeholders together around a common goal
- Focus team efforts towards current goals and priorities
- Revisit and revise project direction based on the outcome of experiments and user-based learning

**You will promote best practices and shared processes, tools, etc. across teams.**

- Reinforce values of building in the open, using open source, being transparent, and having a priority for user-centered design
- Explore new tools, methodologies, etc. and share lessons with other team members and tech fellows
- Mentor others, give constructive criticism, and improve practices and standards on your teams
- Actively engage with the team at large: take part in cross-project and cross-domain conversation, share skills and knowledge
