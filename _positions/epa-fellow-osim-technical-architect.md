- Elasticsearch and/or SOLR to support cross-application searches
- Bootstrap for responsive behavior, knockout.js for automated DOM/javascript object binding, pager.js for single-page application navigation
- jQuery and jQuery ajax for REST access to granular services 


##Key Objectives:
**You will serve as the innovative technical leader in the development of agency modernization strategies for the the highly complex and significant systems across the Office of Science Information Management.**

- Use modern research methods and best practices, to fully understand the real needs of our users
- Perform hands-on solution design, solution architectures, architecture roadmaps, prototyping, proof-of-concepts, and development tasks

- Contribute high-quality, well-tested, maintainable infrastructure configurations, including code-based automation, to successfully impact the efficiency and effectiveness across the entire project lifecycle, using modern software development, open source, and industry best practices

**You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices through teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing.**

- Guide and coach the team on UX, especially colleagues who are taking on new tasks and roles within user-centered design and research
- Practice and enthusiastically share agile and DevOps methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle and infrastructure maintenance
