###Role Summary
18F is looking for web designers who are excited about using modern web technology to make useful and beautiful products for the American public. You will work with a talented and diverse group of dedicated colleagues and agency partners at each step in the process, from product strategy to user experience, content and visual design to engineering. You will have the opportunity to research and develop new technologies and make meaningful contributions to the open source community. We’re building a new practice within government from the ground up, and this role is an opportunity to inform and shape the way that government web sites are designed and developed for years to come.

### Key Objectives

**Objective \#1: Represent front end design on multi-disciplinary teams and work with your colleagues to deliver great products.**

- Work with 18F engineers, UX designers, content specialists, and product owners to create meaningful projects for government agencies.
- Write clean, cohesive, and semantic HTML and CSS through constructive feedback and review sessions.
- Use tools and approaches that help the team deliver quality work on time, understanding that “perfect is the enemy of done.”
- Create design options that meet user needs through wireframes or HTML/CSS prototypes, and iterate based on feedback.
- Have a good understanding of design principles such as layout, typography, and color.
- Work with teams to conduct and analyze user research to inform design decisions.

**Objective \#2: Help 18F and agency partners improve by embodying and advocating for front end design best practices and resources.**

- Attend remote and in-person events with 18F and U.S. Digital Coalition peers.
- Pair program with peers and teammates to help teach, learn, and maintain front end code standards.
- Attend and contribute to design critiques to both hone your own design sense and improve team-wide work.
- Contribute to the 18F Front End Guild through code contributions, attending meetings, and providing your meaningful perspective on the direction of 18F front end design.
- Provide feedback during code and design reviews and be open to criticism and feedback on your work.
- Use the tools and resources adopted or created by 18F, evangelize them, and make improvements when necessary.

**Objective \#3: You will be a contributing and active member in the open source community.**

-   Develop and design 18F’s open source projects to support the growth and development of 18F’s [open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy).
-   Work with the 18F design team on what it means to “design in the open.”
-   Contribute to and help maintain 18F’s [front end standards](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/).


## What's the difference between an 18F front end designer and front end developer?

We expect our front end designers to have visual design as well as HTML and CSS, along with some JavaScript experience. They should feel comfortable brainstorming and developing design options to meet user needs; developing wireframes or HTML/CSS prototypes to test their design ideas; and quickly iterating on feedback. However, they are not expected to create, for example, custom illustrations as a pure visual designer might. On the code side, they should feel comfortable working as a front end developer on projects and implementing accessible HTML5 and CSS3. JavaScript experience is a plus, but expertise isn't required.

By contrast, our front end developers are not expected to have design experience. Instead, they are expected to have much more experience than our front end designers with JavaScript, including strict mode compliance, modularization techniques and tools, and frameworks and libraries. They are expected to be fully comfortable writing vanilla JavaScript, working with APIs, and making front end code perform as efficiently as possible.
