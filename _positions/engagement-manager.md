As a member of the 18F Consulting team, Engagement Managers play the
critical role of supporting a multi-disciplinary team of highly-skilled 18F experts in
delivering services to agency clients. By setting up our client
engagement teams for success, you’ll transform the way agencies deliver
digital and tech services to their constituencies (e.g., individuals
with disabilities, veterans with service-related health issues).

You’ll work alongside a small, yet focused team of other 18F Consulting
specialists. They are experts in design, product strategy, technical
architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In
addition, you will be part of the broader network of all of 18F, which
includes over a 100 digital specialists.

You’ll work on different types of projects that could come from any
federal agency. Some projects will improve services that millions of
people use and others might be important processes that a few hundred
use, but in turn affects how government works. Depending on the nature
of the work and the methods that you use, you can affect change in just
a few months, and sometimes in just a few days.

## Key Objectives

Within the first 6-12 months after hiring, you’ll accomplish these
objectives:

### Objective \#1: Manage one or more client engagements to improve or transform the way they deliver digital/tech services to users.

-   Translate the client’s objectives and constraints and 18F’s capacity and capabilities into an engagement approach that will deliver a unique experience and impactful results in the shortest amount of time possible (we don’t want the client to be dependent upon us forever).

-   Assemble a multi-disciplinary team of resources from a variety of sources (e.g., 18F, contractors, agency client) to deliver the engagement.

-   Set up the team for successful delivery by preparing the agency for 18F’s arrival (e.g., agile training workshop), removing obstacles (or blockers to progress), constantly helping the team to become more collaborative and self-organizing, and enabling the work the team does rather than impose how it’s done.

-   Provide 18F management visibility into the status and health of the client engagement, including the effective flow of information to enable *management by exception.*

-   Spread 18F’s culture to the client’s agency.

-   Delight the client with our work, and leave them better off than they were before (i.e., on a sustainable path to better and better performance).

-   Measure the qualitative and quantitative impact that 18F made.

### Objective \#2: Constantly improve the way 18F Consulting manages client engagements, and actively and openly sharing knowledge of best practices.

-   Continually conduct retrospectives with clients and members of the 18F Consulting team to learn what is and isn’t working well across the board, and formulate and implement improvement actions.

-   Develop and refine flexible standards for how 18F Consulting engages clients, from beginning to end.

-   Contribute content to the [18F Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/) on good practices for managing client engagements.

-   Write several blog posts on the [18F Blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/) on important client management topics and case studies.
