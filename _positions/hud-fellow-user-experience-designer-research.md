##Role Summary:
User experience designers research, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts visually, and work with developers and product managers to build them. No one can be equally expert at each phase, but we expect strong skills in craft, confidence, and sophistication in user research for this position. (Information architecture and interaction design skills are a bonus.) Part of the UX designer’s role is to help teams who are doing user-centered design improve their practice — and teams who are not get started. Our commitment to improving the EPA’s services is a commitment to building products and services with the user in mind.

##Key Objectives:
**You will make strong technical contributions in the UX discipline of research to help deliver projects for the US department of housing and urban development (HUD).**

- Communicate ideas clearly in visual form using flowcharts, storyboards, or other methods to guide development
- Pursue continuing engagement with actual users
- Participate in planning and conducting thoughtful and ethical user research
- Collaborate on cross-functional teams using agile or lean sprints while guiding them towards a strategic vision
- Use modern research methods and best practices, understanding that there are exceptions to every rule
- Commit to making what the digital services team builds fully accessible to the people HUD serves
- Shadow, perform contextual interviews, and otherwise interact with members of the public who rely on HUD’s services

**You will advance the UX practice at HUD.**

- Guide and coach the team on UX, especially colleagues who are taking on new tasks and roles within user-centered design and research
- Promote empathy not just towards members of the public, but also our co-workers
- Clearly explain user-centered design methods and their value to non-designers, including newcomers to the idea of iterative design
- Write content to share what the EPA digital services team makes and how we make it
- Apply user-centered perspectives and processes to everything we do, including internal projects
- Identify potential or current problems for UX that aren’t being addressed, and take the responsibility to address them

**You will balance multiple organizational objectives and values.** 

- Effectively manage time, whether timelines speed up or hit unexpected slow-downs 
- Set realistic expectations for recruiting research participants and conducting research clearly and explicitly with collaborators. Ask for help before a crisis sets in
