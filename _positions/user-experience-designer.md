##Role: User Experience Designer

###Role Summary
User experience designers at 18F research, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts visually, and work with developers and product managers to build them. No one can be equally expert at each phase, but we expect strong skills in craft, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following: interaction design, user research, or information architecture. Part of the UX team’s job at 18F is to help teams who are doing user-centered design improve their practice — and teams who are not get started. Our commitment to improving government services is a commitment to building products and services with the user in mind.

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will make strong technical contributions in at least one UX discipline to help deliver a project for a partner agency.**
- Communicate ideas clearly in visual form using wireframes, site maps, flowcharts, storyboards, or other methods to guide development.
- Pursue continuing engagement with  actual users.
- Participate in planning and conducting thoughtful and ethical user research.
- Collaborate on cross-functional teams using agile or lean sprints while guiding them towards a strategic vision.
- Use modern interaction design patterns and best practices, understanding that there are exceptions to every rule.
- Commit to making what we build fully accessible to the people we serve. 
- Shadow, perform contextual interviews, and otherwise interact with members of the public who rely on government services. 

**Objective #2: You will advance UX practice at 18F.**
- Guide and coach the 18F team on UX, especially colleagues who are taking on new tasks and roles within user-centered design and research. 
- Promote empathy not just towards members of the public, but also our partners across the government and our co-workers. 
- Clearly explain user-centered design methods and their value to non-designers, including newcomers to the idea of iterative design.
- Write blog posts that share what we make and how we make. 
- Talk about 18F work at conferences, hackathons, demo days, or other public-facing events.
- Contribute to government-wide efforts to support best practices in design.

**Objective #3: You will balance multiple organizational objectives and values.**
- Effectively manage time, whether timelines speed up or hit unexpected slow-downs.   
- Set realistic expectations for recruiting research participants and conducting research clearly and explicitly with collaborators. Ask for help before a crisis sets in. 

**Objective #4: You will help make 18F a great place to work.**
- Mediate inevitable team disagreements, and try to negotiate positive compromises. 
- Identify potential or current problems for UX at 18F that aren’t being addressed, and take the responsibility to address the. Apply user-centered perspectives and processes to everything we do, including internal projects.
