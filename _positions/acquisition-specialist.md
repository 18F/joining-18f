##Role: Acquisition Specialist

###Role Summary
As an 18F acquisition specialist, you’ll need to possess two key qualities: excellent judgment and an unflinching belief that federal procurement can be not just efficient, but joyful, too. Acquisition specialists contribute to our team and help agency partners in three main ways: First, by helping teams support digital services through their procurement efforts; second, by investigating other agencies’ tools and processes and finding opportunities to improve results; and third, by working with 18F’s assigned contracting officers to help procure goods and services for 18F and 18F's partner agencies. Federal acquisition experience isn’t required, but it would definitely be helpful for this role. Likewise, a technology background isn’t required, but it too would be very helpful. Good humor and empathy are key requirements.

###Key Objectives
**Objective #1: You will help make the government a better customer by transforming the way we buy digital services.**

- Lead Request for Proposal (RFP) Ghostwriting efforts: Help partner agencies shape their acquisition documents to reflect the leading industry practices in digital-services procurement.
- Work with cross-functional consulting teams within partner agencies to promote modernization efforts and implementation of agile practices. 
- Assist, on behalf of 18F and partner agencies, in the acquisition of digital services during the entire procurement lifecycle. 
- Diversify the government’s buying options by creating new contract vehicles and establishing vendor marketplaces. 

**Objective #2: You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices through research, teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing.**

- Develop hypotheses and conduct tests, and use your findings to enhance the procurement of digital services.
- Conduct workshops to facilitate learning about and adoption of agile principles and practices. 
- Contribute content to the [18F Guides](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/05/28/18F-guides/). 
- Write blog posts on the 18F blog on important acquisition topics and client case studies. (You can see our previous blog posts about procurement [here](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/procurement/).)
