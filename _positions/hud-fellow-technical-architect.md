##Role Summary:
As a member of the Digital Service team, the technical architects will provide technical leadership to bridge modernization efforts at HUD. Your challenge as a technical architect is to help those agencies that have come to depend on legacy technology stacks, transition to more modern technologies such as Node,js, Ruby on Rails and cloud platforms. You will work to understand the needs and the desires of client, design systems to meet those needs and work cross functionally to implement those solutions. 

By doing so, you’ll greatly increase the government’s overall capacity to spend scarce IT budget resources on innovative projects, improving the digital experience for those seeking public housing.

##Key Objectives:

- Use the open source community to support the deployment of services and to stay on top of innovative technologies
- Ensure strategic alignment of technical design/architecture to meet business growth and direction
- Drive planning and delivery by utilizing agile tools such as product roadmaps, backlogs, measurable success criteria, and write user stories
- Engage in the solicitation, evaluation and selection and management of external vendors
- Inspire honesty and integrity through open communication and liberal knowledge sharing across a multidisciplinary team

**You will develop and support the implementation of an enterprisewide, technology modernization strategy.**

- Understand the client’s needs and business objectives
- Assess the client’s current technical environment to find opportunities to simplify, refactor, and use existing investments in IT
- Determine the future state architecture based on where the client needs to be in order to meet its objectives
- Develop an iterative and incremental path to modernize the client’s technical environment, including proof-of-concept testing to validate architectural hypotheses
- Provide consulting and hands-on support for the migration to IaaS providers, including assessment, proof of concept, data migration, application migration, and optimization

**You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices through teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing.**

- Deliver educational workshops to accelerate learning and adoption of agile development and DevOps principles and practices
- Share your wins and findings across government and the tech industry
