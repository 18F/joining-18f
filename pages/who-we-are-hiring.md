We're looking for candidates who are passionate about our mission, with top-notch software development, design, content, and operations skills to match. Below you will find a list of our upcoming job openings.

## Who is eligible to work at 18F

Any individual who is not currently a GSA employee or contractor and who is a U.S. Citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S., or has been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and holds a valid green card is eligible to apply.

## 18F is an Equal Opportunity Employer
We’re building a team that looks like the United States, and we don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.

## Where we are hiring

Everywhere in the United States! If you have no experience working on remote teams or are applying for a role that requires in-person interactions with clients, we'll ask you to work out of our San Francisco or D.C. office. However, much of our team is distributed across the country in places like Chicago, New York, Raleigh, Tuscon, Austin, Dayton, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland.

## Upcoming positions
We're currently revamping our application process. When it relaunches in mid-November, we will be hiring for positions including the following:

###DevOps engineer
Our DevOps engineers work tirelessly to arm developers with the best tools and ensure system uptime and performance. They're comfortable with bridging gaps with legacy development or operations teams.

###Software development (front end)
Using modern, open source web frameworks and tools, our front and back end developers work in small, cross-functional teams to produce functional, scalable web services.

###Visual and interaction design
Our designers create wireframes, HTML prototypes, high-fidelity mockups, and more, based on a firm understanding of user needs. They do what it takes to communicate (and sometimes implement) these solutions.

###Product management (DC-based)
Product leads work closely with agency partners to define and prioritize product value in agile cycles. They remove blocks for the team, create and groom backlogs, champion user testing, and ensure we're always shipping valuable code.
