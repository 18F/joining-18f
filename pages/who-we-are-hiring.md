## Who is eligible to work at 18F

Any individual who is not currently a GSA employee or contractor and who is a U.S. Citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S., or has been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and holds a valid green card is eligible to apply.

## 18F is an Equal Opportunity Employer
We’re building a team that looks like the United States, and we don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.

## Where we are hiring

Everywhere in the United States! Most of our team is distributed across the country in places like Chicago, New York, Raleigh, Tucson, Austin, Dayton, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland. [Read more about how our work culture supports distributed teams.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/) If you have no experience working on remote teams or are applying for a role that requires in-person interactions with clients, we'll ask you to work out of our offices in San Francisco or D.C.
