We're looking for candidates who are passionate about our mission, with top-notch software development, design, content, and operations skills to match. Below you will find a list of our current job openings.

## Who is eligible to work at 18F

U.S. citizens, non-citizens who are nationals of the U.S., or people who have been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and hold a valid green card.

## Where we are hiring

Everywhere in the United States! If you have no experience working on remote teams or are applying for a role that requires in-person interactions with clients, we'll ask you to work out of our San Francisco or D.C. office. However, much of our team is distributed across the country in places like Chicago, New York, Raleigh, Tuscon, Austin, Dayton, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland.

## Open positions
We're actively hiring for the following positions:

###Software development (front end)
Using modern, open source web frameworks and tools, our front and back end developers work in small, cross-functional teams, close to user research and product prioritization, to produce functional, scalable web services.

###Visual and interaction design
Our designers create wireframes, HTML prototypes, high-fidelity mockups, and more, based on a firm understanding of user needs. They do what it takes to communicate (and sometimes implement) these solutions.

###Product management (DC-based)
Product Leads work closely with agency partners to define and prioritize product value in agile cycles. They remove blocks for the team, create and groom backlogs, champion user testing and ensure we are always shipping valuable code.
