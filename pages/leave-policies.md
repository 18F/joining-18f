### Annual Leave

Annual leave accrues at a different rate depending on how long you have worked for the federal government. If you've worked for the federal government for less than three years, you accrue four hours of annual leave per pay period. If you've worked for the federal government for between three and 15 years, you accrue six hours per pay period. After 15 years, you accrue eight hours per pay period.

The maximum annual leave that can be carried over from year to year is 240 hours (30 days). If you transfer from another federal agency, your annual leave will transfer with you.

### Sick Leave 

Sick leave accrues at four hours per pay period for all federal employees, no matter how long they have worked for the federal government. There is no maximum amount of sick leave you can accrue and all unused hours will carry over to the next year. If you transfer from another federal agency, your sick leave will transfer with you.

### Parental Leave 

For all the gorey details, please see this [recent OPM guidance](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/handbook-on-leave-and-workplace-flexibilities-for-childbirth-adoption-and-foster-care.pdf). For a human readable summary...

Both parents may use annual or sick leave after the birth of a child for the period of the mother’s incapacitation. The length of the medically necessary leave is *ultimately determined by a doctor’s note*, but 6 weeks for a vaginal birth and 8 weeks for a cesarean birth is common. After exhausting annual and sick leave, you may also run a sick leave deficit of 6 weeks.

Employees may also apply for annual leave donations from other federal employees within their agency. Leave donations can only be used for the medically necessary leave period described above. Leave donations from federal employees outside of the GSA will be considered and evaluated on a case by case basis. Additionally, spouses who work at another federal agency may donate unlimited annual leave to their partners, regardless of which agency they work for. Leave donations can be used to backfill sick leave and annual leave deficits. 

**In addition** to the paid leave described above, employees are also eligible to take Leave Without Pay (under FMLA) for up to 12 weeks per calendar year. You can take this leave within one year of the birth of your child. You also do not need to take it all at once. Employees are eligible to take intermittent leave within the first year of their child’s birth. For instance, you could take unpaid leave on Tuesdays and Thursdays for several weeks in a row.
