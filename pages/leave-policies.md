### Annual leave

Annual leave accrues at a different rate depending on how long you've worked for the federal government. If you've worked for the federal government fewer than three years, you accrue four hours of annual leave per pay period (which equates to 13 days per year). If you've worked for the federal government between three and 15 years, you accrue six hours per pay period. After 15 years, you accrue eight hours per pay period.

The maximum annual leave you can carry over from calendar year to calendar year is 240 hours. If you transfer from another federal agency, your annual leave transfers with you.

### Sick leave 

Sick leave accrues at four hours per pay period for all federal employees, regardless of how long they've worked for the federal government. There is no maximum amount of sick leave you can accrue, and all unused hours carry over to the next calendar year. If you transfer from another federal agency, your sick leave transfers with you.

### Unpaid leave

Employees can request unpaid leave of less than four weeks at any time.
Unlike parental leave, below, you do not have to have been employed for 12 months.

### Parental leave 

For complete details, see [this recent guidance](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/handbook-on-leave-and-workplace-flexibilities-for-childbirth-adoption-and-foster-care.pdf). In summary:

Federal employees are entitled to use sick leave after the birth of a child or for purposes related to adoption. Both parents may use their annual or sick leave after the birth of a child, for the period of the birth mother’s medical recovery. The length of medically necessary leave is *ultimately determined by a doctor’s note*, but six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a cesarean birth is common. If a parent does not have sufficient sick leave, they can run a sick leave deficit of up to the amount they will accrue in the remainder of their tenure. 

Parents may use annual leave to continue their leave beyond the medically necessary leave period. If a parent does not have sufficient annual leave, they can run an annual leave deficit up to the amount they will accrue in the remainder of the calendar year.

Employees may also apply for annual leave donations from other federal employees within their agency. Leave donations may only be used for the medically necessary leave period, as determined by the doctor's note. Leave donations from federal employees outside GSA are considered on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, if spouses are both employed by the federal government, they may donate an unlimited amount of annual leave to each other, regardless of the agencies they work for. Leave donations can be used to backfill sick leave and annual leave deficits. 

**In addition** to the paid leave described above, employees can take leave without pay. Once you have been an employee of the federal government for at least 12 months, you're eligible to take leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for up to 12 weeks per calendar year. You can take this leave within one year of the birth of your child. You do not need to take it all at once. Employees are eligible to take intermittent leave within the first year of their child’s birth. For instance, you could take unpaid leave on Tuesdays and Thursdays for several weeks in a row.

Employees who have not been with the the federal government for 12 months and do not qualify for leave under the FMLA may take unpaid leave with approval by their supervisor.
