### Annual Leave

- If you worked for the federal government for less than three years, you accrue four (4) hours of annual leave per pay period.
- If you worked for the federal government for more than three years but less than 15 years, you accrue six (6) hours of annual leave per pay period.
- If you worked for the federal government for more than 15 years, you accrue eight (8) hours of annual leave per pay period.
- The maximum annual leave that can be carried over is 240 hours.
- If you transferred from another federal agency, your annual leave will transfer with you. It may take 2 - 4 pay periods before EmployeeExpress will display your annual leave.
- If after 4 pay periods, your leave does not appear. Please contact your HR Representative at your former Federal Agency.
- You may use advanced leave with supervisor approval

### Sick Leave 

- All federal employees, no matter how long they have worked, accrue four (4) hours of sick leave per pay period.
- There is no maximum amount of sick leave hours you can accrue.
- All unused hours will carry over to the next year.
- If you transferred from another federal agency, your sick leave will transfer with you. It may take 2 - 4 pay periods before EmployeeExpress will display your sick leave.
- If after 4 pay periods, your leave does not appear. Please contact your HR Representative at your former Federal Agency.

### Parental Leave 

For all the gorey details, please see this [recent OPM guidance](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/handbook-on-leave-and-workplace-flexibilities-for-childbirth-adoption-and-foster-care.pdf). For a human readable summary...

Both parents may use annual or sick leave after the birth of a child for the period of the mother’s incapacitation. The length of the medically necessary leave is *ultimately determined by a doctor’s note*, but 6 weeks for a vaginal birth and 8 weeks for a cesarean birth is common. After exhausting annual and sick leave, you may also run a sick leave deficit of 6 weeks.

Employees may also apply for annual leave donations from other federal employees within their agency. Leave donations can only be used for the medically necessary leave period described above. Leave donations from federal employees outside of the GSA will be considered and evaluated on a case by case basis. Additionally, spouses who work at another federal agency may donate unlimited annual leave to their partners, regardless of which agency they work for. Leave donations can be used to backfill sick leave and annual leave deficits. 

**In addition** to the paid leave described above, employees are also eligible to take Leave Without Pay (under FMLA) for up to 12 weeks per calendar year. You can take this leave within one year of the birth of your child. You also do not need to take it all at once. Employees are eligible to take intermittent leave within the first year of their child’s birth. For instance, you could take unpaid leave on Tuesdays and Thursdays for several weeks in a row.
