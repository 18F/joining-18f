### Phone screen

Apply to 18F by emailing your resume to [join18f@gsa.gov](mailto:join18f@gsa.gov). Within three weeks our team will review your resume, and if you seem like a good fit, we'll reach out to schedule a 30-minute phone call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here. 

### In-person (or videochat) interviews

After your phone interview, the 18F member you spoke to will submit their notes to our Talent Team. If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer interviews. Depending on what position you're applying for, the format will vary, but generally we group interviews with multiple candidates together into bi-weekly hiring sprints, every other Friday. 

### Security clearance

All government positions require some kind of background check. Most positions at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.
