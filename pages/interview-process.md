## Application collection
Applications are collected and grouped in two-week intervals. All applications collected within each two-week period are treated as a cohort and evaluated against each other.

**Note:** Once an application period ends, no additions or modifications can be made to your application. However, there is no limit to the number of times you can apply.

## Application review (Qualification)
The first step of the process will be a review of the information that you have submitted as part of your application. Applications are evaluated using the practices of the qualification processes called [Category Rating](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-authorities/competitive-hiring/#url=Category-Rating). Your application is evaluated against the competencies listed below and placed in one of the following categories: Superior Qualified, Best Qualified, Well Qualified, Qualified, or Not Qualified. We also apply [Veterans' Preference](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/index.aspx).

Once all applications within the two-week cohort have been evaluated, they're given to the selection panel, which will review and identify the applicants that they wish to interview.

## Preliminary screening

The interview process begins with a 30-minute preliminary screening by phone or video call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here.

## In-person (or videochat) interviews

After your phone interview, the 18F member you spoke to will submit their notes to our Talent Team. If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer conversations.

## Application qualification competencies
During the qualification and evaluation process, we will assess you and your application against the following competencies:

- **Analysis and creative problem solving:** Expertise determining user
needs or identifying market opportunities and designing and
deploying solutions.
- **Technology acumen:** Knowledge of standard and emergent web
technologies.
- **Entrepreneurship and product management:** Experience delivering
products or services from concept to market.
- **Approach and methodology:** Expertise applying frameworks that
emphasize delivery, iteration, quantitative and qualitative learnings,
and responsiveness.
- **Empathy and emotional intelligence:** Experience in client-facing
roles, navigating bureaucracy, business development, or delivering
services with a strong user-facing or consumer-oriented element.
- **Tools and execution:** Experience in design, development, and
deployment of solutions leveraging current and emergent
technologies and best practices.
