### Application review

The first step of the process will be a review of the information that you have submitted as part of your application. If your application is found to be qualified, you will proceed to the interview process.

### Phone screen

The first step in the interview process is the phone screen, a 30-minute phone call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here.

### In-person (or videochat) interviews
