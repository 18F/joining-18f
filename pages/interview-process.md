title: The 18F Interview Process
---

### Phone screen

After you submit your application through [U.S. Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service/apply) within three weeks, our team will review your resume. If it seems like you are a good fit for 18F, we will reach out to schedule a 30-minute phone call. On the phone call, plan to talk more about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here at 18F. 



### In-Person (or Videochat) Interviews

After your phone chat, the 18F-er you chatted with will submit their notes to our Talent Team. If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations, or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer interviews. Depending on what position you're applying for, the format will vary a bit, but generally we group interviews with multiple candidates together into bi-weekly hiring sprints. Every other Friday, members of our team gather to interview candidates. 

### Security Clearance

If you're new to working for the federal government, it's important to know that all government positions require some kind of background check. Most positions at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private sector background checks, but not as intensive as a higher security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will be there to guide you. 

### Basic rubric and criteria

After your interview, the interviewer(s) will evaluate along the basic rubric below. Interviewers evaluate candidates without discussing the candidate with their interview partner or other team members. After a written evaluation, all interviewers will meet and discuss the candidate.

### Interviewing for the engineering team

If you are a software developer and applying to work on our Engineering team, you will have two interviews: a technical interview, and a core values interview. Although each interview is different, we generally follow the format described below. Sometimes we find one aspect of a candidate's work particularly fascinating, and we'll want to spend more time talking about it. Or we might be having a really nice discussion on architecture and we don't want it to end. You should come prepared to discuss previous software you've built, why you architected it the way that you did, and what you learned from it.

##### Technical interview format

 - An introduction  (~ 5 min)
 - Technical questions about the candidate’s previous work and experience that can be answered and discussed without coding on a whiteboard (NO brainteasers)  (~20 min)
 - Code reviewing a piece of  preselected code  (~15-20 min) 
 - Some time devoted to a highly coached “think out loud” code writing or system diagramming session. This could include writing or discussing a short function or adding a small feature to an existing piece of code (~30-40 min)
 - Time for the candidate to ask questions of us (~15 min)

##### Core values interview format 

This interview can be a little more of a freeform discussion, but it should drive at the qualifications described in the Core Values section below. 

 - Intros (~5 min)
 - Why this candidate wants to work at 18F, previous civic oriented service (~15 min)
 - Discussion of past work in teams, including the processes, locations (remote vs on site) and how they would like to work in the future (~15 min)
 - Discussion of previous work or thoughts and feelings about open source software, agile/iterative development, developing for the user (~25 min)
 - Discussion of how the candidate has handled previous conflict, past failures and successes, and where they see opportunities for growth (~20 min)

### Interviewing for a Product Lead position

There isn't one description that matches the role of all Product Leads at 18F. Ultimately, it depends on the nature of the relationship between 18F and a partner agency.  Some relationships have one account manager with multiple product managers who focus on building out separate products while others have one person who is an Account Manager/Product Manager hybrid. No matter where you fall on the spectrum between Account Manager, Product Manager (and both!), you'll have three interviews:

##### Core Values Interview (1 hour)
We want to know about what you're passionate about, how you worked with teams in the past and why you think 18F is a good fit for you. We expect you to ask the same of us. 

##### Problem Solving Interview (1 hour)
We'll present you with hypothetical problems and actual problems that we've faced to see how you would handle them. We’re also very curious about your response to problems that you’ve faced in your experience.

##### Technical Interview (1 hour)
This is where we dive deep into the process, methodologies and tools that you use to get the job done and your beliefs on how teams should work together.  

#### Interviewing for design, team operations, and content
