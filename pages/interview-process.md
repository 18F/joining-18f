### Application review

The first step of the process will be a review of the information that you have submitted as part of your application. Your application will be evaluated against the Qualification Competencies detailed below.

### Preliminary screening

The interview process begins with a preliminary screening, a 30-minute phone or video call. Plan to talk about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here.

### In-person (or videochat) interviews

After your phone interview, the 18F member you spoke to will submit their notes to our Talent Team. If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer interviews.

### Application qualification competencies
During the qualification and evaluation process, we will assess you and your application against the following competencies:

- **Analysis and creative problem solving:** Expertise determining user
needs or identifying market opportunities and designing and
deploying solutions.
- **Technology acumen:** Knowledge of standard and emergent web
technologies.
- **Entrepreneurship and product management:** Experience delivering
products or services from concept to market.
- **Approach and methodology:** Expertise applying frameworks that
emphasize delivery, iteration, quantitative and qualitative learnings,
and responsiveness.
- **Empathy and emotional intelligence:** Experience in client-facing
roles, navigating bureaucracy, business development, or delivering
services with a strong user-facing or consumer-oriented element.
- **Tools and execution:** Experience in design, development and
deployment of solutions leveraging current and emergent
technologies and best practices.
