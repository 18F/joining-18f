title: The 18F Interview Process
---

### First Steps

If you'd like to apply to 18F, the first thing you should do is write us an email (join18f@gsa.gov) introducing yourself, with your resume attached. Within three weeks, our team will review your resume and if it seems like you might be a fit for 18F, we will reach out to schedule a 30-minute phone call. On the phone call, plan to talk more about your skills and experience, what you're passionate about, and the work we do here at 18F. 

### In-Person (or Videochat) Interviews

After your phone chat, the 18F-er you chatted with will submit their notes to our Talent Team. If we'd like to chat with you more, we'll ask you to come in to one of our office locations, or join us somewhere on the internet for a couple of longer interviews. Depending on what position you're applying for, the format will vary a bit, but generally we group interviews with multiple candidates together into bi-weekly hiring sprints. Every other Friday, members of our team gather to interview candidates. 

#### Interviewing for the Engineering Team

If you are a software developer and applying to work on our Engineering team, you will have two interviews: a technical interview, and a core values interview. Although each interview is different, we generally follow the format described below. Sometimes we find one aspect of a candidate's work particularly fascinating, and we'll want to spend more time talking about it. Or we might be having a really nice discussion on architecture and we don't want it to end. You should come prepared to discuss previous software you've built, why you architected it the way that you did, and what you learned from it.

##### Technical Interview Format

 - An introduction  (~ 5 min)
 - Technical questions about the candidate’s previous work and experience that can be answered and discussed without coding on a whiteboard (NO brainteasers)  (~20 min)
 - Code reviewing a piece of  preselected code  (~15-20 min) 
 - Some time devoted to a highly coached “think out loud” code writing or system diagramming session. This could include writing or discussing a short function or adding a small feature to an existing piece of code (~30-40 min)
 - Time for the candidate to ask questions of us (~15 min)

##### Core Values Interview Format 

This interview can be a little more of a freeform discussion, but it should drive at the qualifications described in the Core Values section below. 

 - Intros (~5 min)
 - Why this candidate wants to work at 18F, previous civic oriented service (~15 min)
 - Discussion of past work in teams, including the processes, locations (remote vs on site) and how they would like to work in the future (~15 min)
 - Discussion of previous work or thoughts and feelings about open source software, agile/iterative development, developing for the user (~25 min)
 - Discussion of how the candidate has handled previous conflict, past failures and successes, and where they see opportunities for growth (~20 min)
