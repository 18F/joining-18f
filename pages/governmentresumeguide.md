*For your most relevant, recent and/or longest held positions you should list a minimum of 8-10
bullet points. After that, it is ok to gradually lessen the number of bullet point descriptions.* <br>

*Unrelated jobs held many years ago do not need more than 1 or 2 bullet points, however,
transferrable skills such as management, communication, and problem solving should be
highlighted, as those are relevant skills.* <br>
