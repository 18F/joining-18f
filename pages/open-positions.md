We're briefly pausing accepting new applications while we evolve how 18F plans for open roles.

If you'd like to learn about open roles as they come available, you can sign up for the biweekly [18F Newsletter](https://18f.gsa.gov/#newsletter).

## Opportunities with 18F partners
We’re currently supporting other agencies’ recruiting efforts to build digital service and innovation teams. Below you’ll find a list of the current positions along with their associated agencies. For all of these opportunities, please note:

- You must have availability to interview prior to Friday, September 23, 2016.
- You must be in the D.C. area or willing to relocate to D.C. Unfortunately, we can’t provide relocation assistance.

If you’re interested in these opportunities, please email a detailed resume to [join18f@gsa.gov](mailto:join18f@gsa.gov) and reference the position you are interested in. You may apply to more than one role.
