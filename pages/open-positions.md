The positions that we currently have available at 18F are posted here. These positions utilize a [Direct Hiring Authority](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/direct-hire-authority/#url=Fact-Sheet). This differs slightly from the usual 18F process listed on our site but our talent team staff will guide you through the process. 

These are the only roles that we are hiring for; as new roles become available they'll be listed here.

- [Application Security Engineer]({{ site.baseurl }}/infosec/application-security-engineer/)
- [Penetration Tester]({{ site.baseurl }}/infosec/penetration-tester/)
- [Security Operations Engineer]({{ site.baseurl }}/infosec/security-operations-engineer/)

If you want to know more about what itâ€™s like to be part of 18F, please send a note to <a href="mailto:join18f@gsa.gov">join18f@gsa.gov</a>.
