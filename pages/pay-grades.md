title: Government pay grades explained
---

Every federal employee is hired at a general schedule (GS) grade from 1 to 15. GS grades are based on education, background, experience, and the position within 18F. Inside each grade is a series of 10 steps. Employees typically start at step one of whatever GS grade they are assigned. Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/)

18F hires at the following grades: 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Your corresponding annual pay depends on your grade, step, and location. See [OPM](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2014/general-schedule/) for more information on salary rates in different locations. **Please note**: the annual salary cap for all federal employees is $158,700. We cannot offer more than this under any circumstance.

### What does this "not to exceed two years" mean? 

Most 18F members are not to exceed (NTE) employees. This means you cannot work at 18F on your position description (PD) for more than four years. The tentative and final offer both say two years, but you are eligible to extend for two additional years. The only reason you would not be automatically extended is if you failed to adequately perform your job duties. 

This setup shouldn't cause concern regarding the longevity of 18F as an organization. We believe that in this industry most people aren't going to stick around for four years and beyond. They will join 18F, do their years of service in the federal government, and then return to the private (or public) sector. Due to the high-pressure nature of our work, it makes sense that people will move on after a couple of years. That helps 18F stay fresh and strong.

### When will I get a step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven. 

### Are there bonuses?

Some bonuses are available, but they come after a performance review. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a peformance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
