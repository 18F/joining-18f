title: Government Pay Grades Explained
---

Every federal employee is hired at a General Schedule (GS) grade from Grade 1 to Grade 15. GS grades are based on education, background, experience in your field, and your position within the 18F organization. Inside each grade is a series of 10 steps. Employees typically start at step 1 of whatever GS grade they are assigned. Find out more information about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/)

18F hires at the following grades: 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Your corresponding annual pay depends on your grade, step, and location. See [OPM](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2014/general-schedule/) for more information on salary rates in different locations. **Please note**: the annual salary cap for all federal employees is $158,700. We can not offer more than this under any circumstance.

### What does this Not To Exceed 2 Years mean? 

Most 18F-ers are Not To Exceed (NTE) employees. This means that they cannot work at 18F on this Position Description (PD) for more than four years. It says two years on the tentative and final offer, but you are eligible for two additional years. The only reason you would not be automatically extended is if you were not adequately performing your job duties. 

This setup should not cause concern regarding the longevity of 18F as an organization. We believe that in this industry most people are not going to stick around for four years and beyond. They will join 18F, do their couple years of service in the federal government, and then return to the private sector. Due to the high-pressure nature of our work, it makes sense that people will move on after a couple of years. That will help 18F stay fresh and strong.

### When will I get a step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step. Steps 2, 3, and 4 have a one year period for step increases. Step 5, 6, and 7 are two years between increased and steps 8, 9, and 10 are three years. So if you come in at step 1, the following year you will be a step 2. If you come in at a step 6, it will take 2 years to be a step 7. 

### Are there bonuses?

There are some bonuses that can be awarded, but they come after a Performance Review. You must be an 18F employee for at least  3 months to get a Peformance Review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
