### Joining 18F
Our parent agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), hires 18F team members against a position description for Innovation Specialist. The position description has a GS grade level associated to it. Each applicant is required to select the Innovation Specialist position description, which includes the GS grade level for which they wish to be considered.

The qualification requirements for each position description vary and are based on a number of variables including education, background, accomplishments and experience. Compensation is determined by the grade level associated with the position description.

It’s important to note that the grade level you select during application submission will be the grade level at which GSA hires you, should you be found qualified and subsequently selected for hire. If you apply for a grade level and are not found qualified, you can reapply at a different grade level. There is no penalty or restriction to reapplying.

### Selecting a grade level
The following information can be used to help you decide what grade level for the Innovation Specialist could be the best fit for you. This language is taken directly from the Innovation Specialist position descriptions against which 18F team members are hired:

### General Schedule – Grade Levels
Federal employees are hired at a general schedule (GS) grade from 1 to 15. GS grades are based on the combination of a number of variables including education, background, accomplishments, experience, etc. Inside each grade is a series of 10 steps. Employees typically start at step 1 of whatever GS grade they are assigned. 

Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/).

### Compensation in the GS pay system
GS grade levels specify a fixed compensation range for a particular position, in particular geographic localities, within the federal government. This is also true for 18F, so understanding the relationship between GS grade level, location, and compensation is important when considering applying to our organization.

The annual salary cap for all GS employees is $160,300 per year. You cannot be offered more than this under any circumstance. 

Each GS grade level contains a series of 10 steps which also have an impact on compensation. A new GS employee is usually hired at step 1 of the applicable GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly-appointed federal employee based on a [special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/).

### What does this "not to exceed two years" mean? 

Most 18F members are "not to exceed" (NTE) employees. NTE is  the hiring mechanism we've chosen to use, and it’s part of what has allowed us to grow so fast. The "not to exceed" guidance means you cannot work at 18F in the same position description for more than four years total. Both your tentative and final offer letters state that you can work at 18F for two years, but you’re also eligible to extend your term for another two years, provided you meet certain performance criteria. The only reason your position would not be automatically extended is if you failed to adequately perform your job duties.

### When will I get a step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven. 

### Are there bonuses?

Some bonuses are available, but they come after the year-end review process in late September. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a performance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
