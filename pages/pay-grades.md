title: Government Pay Grades Explained
---

Every employee is hired at a General Service level from Grade 1 - Grade 15. 18F hires at the following grades: 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 depending on background, experience, and position within the 18F Organization. Your corresponding annual pay depends on your location. See [OPM](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2014/general-schedule/) for more information on each locality. **Please note**: the annual cap is $158,700 across the United States. We can not offer more than this under any circumstance.


### What does this Not To Exceed 2 Years mean? 

Most 18F-ers are NTE employees. This means that they cannot work at 18F on this Position Description (PD) for more than 4 years. It says 2 years on the tentative and final offer, but you are eligible for 2 additional years. The only reason you would not be automatically extended is if you were not adequately performing your job duties. 

This setup should not cause concern regarding the longevity of 18F as an organization. We believe that in this industry most people are not going to stick around for 4 years and beyond. They will join 18F, do their time in federal government, and then return to the private sector. Due to the high pressure nature of our work, it makes sense that people will move on after a couple of years or so. That will help 18F stay fresh and strong.

### When will I get a Step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step.  Steps 234 are one year. 567 are two years and 8910 are 3 years. So if you come in at Step 1, the following year you will be a Step 2. If you come in at a Step 6, it will take 2 years to be a Step 7. 

### Are there bonuses?

There are some bonuses that can be awarded but they come after a Performance Review (have to at least be on board at least 3 months). Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
