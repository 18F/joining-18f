### General Schedule - Grade Levels
Federal employees are hired at a general schedule (GS) grade from 1 to 15. GS grades are based on the combination of a number of variables including, education, background, accomplishments, experience, etc. Inside each grade is a series of 10 steps. Employees typically start at step one of whatever GS grade they are assigned. 

Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] (https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/)

### Compensation in the GS pay system
GS Grade Levels specify a fixed compensation range for a particular position within the federal government. This is also true for 18F so understanding the relationships between GS grade level and compensation is important when considering applying to our organization.

The 18F team is made Innovation Specialists at the GS 13, GS 14 and GS 15 levels. Here are the base compensation ranges for each level taken from the [OPM SALARY TABLE 2015-GS](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/15Tables/html/GS.aspx)
- Grade 13 - $73,115.00 to $95,048.00
- Grade 14 - $86,399.00 to  $112,319.00
- Grade 15 - $101,630.00 to $132,122.00

**Please note:** the annual salary cap for all federal employees is $158,700. You cannot be offer more than this under any circumstance.

Those ranges are the base only, they do not include any adjustments for locality pay. Most GS employees are also entitled to locality pay, which is a geographic-based percentage rate that reflects pay levels for non-Federal workers in certain geographic areas as determined by [surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/fact-sheets/tabs/bls-data/). There are currently [34 locality pay areas](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/fact-sheets/tabs/locality-pay-areas/), which cover the lower 48 States and Washington, DC, plus Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories and possessions.

Each GS grade level also contains a series of 10 steps which also have an impact on compensation. A new GS employee is usually hired at step one of the applicable GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly-appointed Federal employee based on a [special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/).

Here is a [GS Salary Calculator](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2015/general-schedule-gs-salary-calculator/) if you would like to see how grade is affected by locality.

### Joining 18F
Our parent agency, General Services Administration, hires 18F team members against a position description for Innovation Specialist with an associated GS Grade level. 18F team members are Innovation Specialists at the GS 13, GS 14 and GS 15 levels. Each applicant is required to select the Innovation Specialist position description, which includes the GS grade level, that they wish to be considered for.

The qualification requirements for each grade level vary and are based on a number of variables including, education, background, accomplishments, experience, etc. Compensation is also determined by the grade level associated with the position description.

It’s important to note that grade level that you select during application submission will be the grade level that the GSA hires you at, should you be found qualified and are selected for hire. If you apply for a grade level and are not found qualified, you can reapply at a different grade level. There is no penalty or restrictions to reapplying. 

### Selecting a Grade Level
The following information can be used to help you decide what grade level for the Innovation Specialist could be the best fit for you. This language is taken directly from the Innovation Specialist position descriptions that 18F team members are hired against. 

This information is intended as a guideline only. Use this information to help think about how your qualifications and experience align with the descriptions of each different grade level.

### What does this "not to exceed two years" mean? 

Most 18F members are not to exceed (NTE) employees. This means you cannot work at 18F on your position description (PD) for more than four years. The tentative and final offer both say two years, but you are eligible to extend for two additional years. The only reason you would not be automatically extended is if you failed to adequately perform your job duties. 

This setup shouldn't cause concern regarding the longevity of 18F as an organization. We believe that in this industry most people aren't going to stick around for four years and beyond. They will join 18F, do their years of service in the federal government, and then return to the private (or public) sector. Due to the high-pressure nature of our work, it makes sense that people will move on after a couple of years. That helps 18F stay fresh and strong.

### When will I get a step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven. 

### Are there bonuses?

Some bonuses are available, but they come after the year-end review process in late September. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a performance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
