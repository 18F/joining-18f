### Joining 18F
Our parent agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), hires 18F team members against a position description for Innovation Specialist. The position description has a GS grade level associated to it. Each applicant is required to select the Innovation Specialist position description, which includes the GS grade level for which they wish to be considered.

The qualification requirements for each position description vary and are based on a number of variables including education, background, accomplishments and experience. Compensation is determined by the grade level associated with the position description.

It’s important to note that the grade level you select during application submission will be the grade level at which GSA hires you, should you be found qualified and subsequently selected for hire. If you apply for a grade level and are not found qualified, you can reapply at a different grade level. There is no penalty or restriction to reapplying.

### Selecting a grade level
The following information can be used to help you decide what grade level for the Innovation Specialist could be the best fit for you. This language is taken directly from the Innovation Specialist position descriptions against which 18F team members are hired:

### General Schedule – Grade Levels
Federal employees are hired at a general schedule (GS) grade from 1 to 15. GS grades are based on the combination of a number of variables including education, background, accomplishments, experience, etc. Inside each grade is a series of 10 steps. Employees typically start at step 1 of whatever GS grade they are assigned. 

Find out more about the GS system from the [Office of Personnel Management (OPM)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/).

### Compensation in the GS pay system
GS grade levels specify a fixed compensation range for a particular position within the federal government. This is also true for 18F, so understanding the relationship between GS grade level and compensation is important when considering applying to our organization.

**Please note:** the annual **base** salary cap for all federal employees is $133,444. You cannot be offered more than this under any circumstance. See below for more information about how locality pay affects your actual salary.

New team members can currently join 18F at GS 13, GS 14 and GS 15. Here are the base compensation ranges for each grade level taken from the [OPM SALARY TABLE 2015-GS](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/16Tables/html/GS.aspx):
- Grade 13 – $73,846 to $96,004
- Grade 14 – $87,263 to $113,444
- Grade 15 – $102,646 to $133,444

**Those ranges are the base rate only; they do not include adjustments for locality pay.** 

Locality pay is how the GS pay system accounts for regional variation in cost of living. Here are locality pay examples for Washington, D.C. and San Francisco:

| |Base (No Locality) |Washington DC Locality | San Francisco Locality |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Grade 14**| $87,263|$108,887|$118,460|

**Try the [GS Salary Calculator](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2016/general-schedule-gs-salary-calculator/) if you'd like to see how your locality affects compensation.**

Locality pay is a geographic-based percentage rate that reflects pay levels for non-federal workers in certain geographic areas as determined by [surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/fact-sheets/tabs/bls-data/). There are currently [34 locality pay areas](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/fact-sheets/tabs/locality-pay-areas/), which cover the lower 48 states and Washington, D.C., plus Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories and possessions.

Each GS grade level contains a series of 10 steps which also have an impact on compensation. A new GS employee is usually hired at step 1 of the applicable GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly-appointed federal employee based on a [special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/).

### What does this "not to exceed two years" mean? 

Most 18F members are not to exceed (NTE) employees. This means you cannot work at 18F on your position description for more than four years. The tentative and final offer both say two years, but you are eligible to extend for two additional years. The only reason you would not be automatically extended is if you failed to adequately perform your job duties. 

This setup shouldn't cause concern regarding the longevity of 18F as an organization. We believe that in this industry most people aren't going to stick around for four years and beyond. They will join 18F, do their years of service in the federal government, and then return to the private (or public) sector. Due to the high-pressure nature of our work, it makes sense that people will move on after a couple of years. That helps 18F stay fresh and strong.

### When will I get a step increase?

There is a different waiting period depending on the step. Steps two, three, and four have a one-year period for step increases. Steps five, six, and seven are two years. Steps eight, nine, and ten are three years. So if you come in at step one, the following year you will be a step two. If you come in at a step six, it will take two years to be a step seven. 

### Are there bonuses?

Some bonuses are available, but they come after the year-end review process in late September. You must be an 18F employee for at least three months to get a performance review. Bonuses are either a small percentage of your annual salary or additional paid time off.
