## Public Service Loan Forgiveness

Since 18F is part of the General Services Administration and you are a federal employee, student loan payments made while you work here will count toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF). The PSLF is a federal program that forgivess any remaining balance on your qualifying loans issued by the U.S. government after 120 on-time, qualifying payments. [Here's some more information about that program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) from the Department of Education's student aid website. 

There are a few details of that program that are relevant for new 18F employees.

### Qualifying for the PSLF

The PSLF bases the forgiveness benefit on the number of _qualified payments_ you make, not months of service. They do not need to be consecutive payments but just becaues you're making a payment doesn't mean it will count. [Here's Student Aid's FAQ what makes a payment a "qualified" payment](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-payment). In theory, you could make 48 payments toward that 120 payment mark. Here are some tips on getting the most out of your time at 18F:

* **Make sure you're on a qualified repayment plan _before_ you start at 18F.** [The qualifying palns are the standard repayment plan and all the income driven plans.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-repayment-plan) Most loan servicers will put you in a forebearance while they convert your payment plan. This can take up to 3 months and payments made during a forebearance or deferral _do not count_ for the PSLF.
* **Try to avoid swithcing repayment plans** while you're employed with 18F. If you're worried about making the monthly payment, [an income based plan might be a good idea](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/node/594/#pros-cons).
* **Only make one payment a month, and don't overpay.** You only get credit for one payment a month, so only pay what you owe and try to avoid double payment.
* **You'll probably only get the benefit if you're on an income driven plan.** Even thought the Standard plan technically qualifies you, your repayment term is 120 months, so even if every payment qualifies for PSLF, you'll be paid in full by the time you get there anyway. [Consider an income-driven repayment plan if it lowers your rate.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/node/594/#pros-cons)

### Pre- and post-18F work

You don't need to work for the federal government to qualify for the PSLF. If you came here from a non-profit, school, or [any other qualifying employer](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-employment) make sure you get your tenure there to count as well. Likewise, if you go to work for one of those places after your term ends, make sure to re-apply through your new employer.

## The federal Student Loan Repayment Program

The [Student Loan Repayment Program](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/student-loan-repayment/) is an option for federal agencies to repay a certain amount of an employee's loans while they are employed. It requires a 3 year commitment from the employee. Since we are on 2 + 2 year terms, at this time **most 18F employees do not qualify for this program.** As such, 18F is not offering this benefit to any candidates.
