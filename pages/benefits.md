### Retirement

[Thrift Savings Plan](https://www.tsp.gov/), the government's version of a 401K, offers up to five percent matching.

### Teleworking

Telework provides flexibility for employees. It improves morale and productivity by allowing for greater collaboration among peers. 18F recognizes these benefits and encourages working from home with administrative supervisor (or designee) approval. This policy adheres to and is in conjunction with [GSA's mobility and telework policy](http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/staffoffices/GSAteleworkpolicy.pdf).

### Commuter

Employees who commute by public transportation may receive subsidies for commuting costs. This benefit aims to reduce traffic congestion, conserve energy, and improve air quality.
