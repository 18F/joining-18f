## Who is eligible to work at 18F

Any individual who is not currently a GSA employee or contractor and who is a U.S. Citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S., or has been admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and holds a valid green card is eligible to apply.

## 18F is an Equal Opportunity Employer
We’re building a team that looks like the United States, and we don't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. If you have the skills we need, that’s all that matters.

## Where we are hiring

Everywhere in the United States! Most of our team is distributed across the country in places like Chicago, New York, Raleigh, Tucson, Austin, Dayton, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland. [Read more about how our work culture supports distributed teams.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/) In some cases we'll ask you to work out of our offices in San Francisco, Chicago or D.C.


## Documents required for the hiring process

**When you apply, you’ll need to submit a government-style resume.** A government-style resume is very different from a private sector resume; one major difference is the depth of detail required throughout the entire resume. Because of the level of detail required, it is completely acceptable for your government-style resume to be several pages long. 

The web has many guides to building a government-style resume and no two resources are alike. [This guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/government-style-resume-guide/) is most relevant to applying to 18F. It also shows how to format a government-style resume and shares the key pieces to include.

Here are additional resources from other organizations, in case you'd like to refer to them: 
- [GoGovernment's Create Your Federal Resume Guide](http://gogovernment.org/how_to_apply/write_your_federal_resume/create_your_resume.php) 
- [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Federal Resume Template](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM279014.pdf)

**Later, after you’ve passed through the 18F [interview
phase]({{ site.baseurl }}/interview-process/)**, your point of contact on the 18F Talent Team will ask you for three professional references (names, titles, and email addresses). Once we hear back from them, the GSA HR Team will ask you for additional documents in order to proceed with the hiring process.

It’s not a bad idea to start to pull these together in advance because some of them take time to complete. All documents should be submitted as a PDF to your point of contact on the GSA HR Team.

## The offer process

The GSA hiring process includes a tentative offer followed by an official offer. Here's how that works:

1.  A GSA HR specialist calls you with a tentative offer, including salary. "Tentative" means it's contingent on security clearance.
2.  If you accept the tentative offer, then we move on to the following steps:
3.  You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken. [See fingerprint locations here](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
4.  You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
5.  You fill out the e-QIP questionnaire (see more below). After that is processed, you receive an interim security clearance.
6.  A GSA HR specialist calls you with a final offer.
7.  We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start every other Monday, which coincides with the start of the GSA pay period.

### Security clearance

All government positions require some kind of background check. Most positions at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.

The questionnaire you'll need to fill out is called [e-QIP](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/). The questions cover seven years worth of employment and location history, among other things. It may take substantial time to collect contact information for previous employers, as well as old addresses. The e-QIP questionnaire is basically a web version of the [SF-85p](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf). This form includes all the questions you'll be asked so you can use it to get a head start.
