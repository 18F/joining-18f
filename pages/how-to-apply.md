## Applications will reopen in mid-November

Our call for talented, civic-minded folks to join 18F has been answered loudly, clearly, and in high numbers. To better handle this influx of applications and to better serve the entire 18F team, we’re embarking on an evaluation of our talent selection process. Like the rest of the products built at 18F, this process demands iterating too.

**We’re currently re-engineering major parts of our talent selection process.** Our goal: to deliver an improved application, interview, and hiring experience.

If you’re interested in joining our team, **please check back in mid-November** for the most up-to-date list of open positions, our new application form, and updated content on our new process and projected hiring timelines.

In the meantime, if you want to hear about the latest at 18F, please follow us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/18F), sign up for our [newsletter](https://18f.gsa.gov/#newsletter), and check out our work on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/18F). 

**If you have applied to 18F recently,** we want to apologize for our slow response time. We haven’t forgotten you — thank you sincerely for your patience. You will receive an email by Friday, November 6 from our Talent Team with an update on your application and next steps.

If you have any questions, please reach our Talent Team at [join18f@gsa.gov](mailto:join18f@gsa.gov).

## Documents required for the hiring process

**When you apply, you’ll need to include a current, government-style resume.** Government-style resumes are very different from private-sector resumes. [Here is a guide](http://gogovernment.org/how_to_apply/write_your_federal_resume/create_your_resume.php) and some [example](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM279014.pdf) [resumes](http://www.jobs.irs.gov/downloads/ResumeTips.pdf). Please overexplain, include dates of each engagement, and include everything and the kitchen sink.

**Later, after you’ve passed through the 18F [interview
phase](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/interview-process/)**, we will
need some additional documents before your application can be processed
by GSA HR. We will let you know when we need each of these documents,
but it’s not a bad idea to start to pull these together in advance
because some of them take time to complete. All documents should be
submitted as a PDF to your point of contact on the 18F Talent Team.

-   **Professional references:** Three professional references (names, titles, and email addresses).
-   **Security clearance**
    -   [OF306 — Declaration for Federal Employment](https://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of0306.pdf)
    -   [GSA 3665 — Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action?mediaId=29769)

These documents will be compiled by the 18F hiring team and sent to the
GSA HR department.

## The offer process

The GSA HR process includes a tentative offer followed by an official offer. Here's how that works:

1.  A GSA HR specialist calls you with a tentative offer, including salary. "Tentative" means it's contingent on security clearance.
2.  If you accept the tentative offer, then we move on to the following steps:
3.  You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken. [See fingerprint locations here](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
4.  You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
5.  You receive an interim security clearance.
6.  A GSA HR specialist calls you with a final offer.
7.  We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start every other Monday, which coincides with the start of the GSA pay period.

### Security clearance


If you're selected for hire and accept your offer, you'll need to complete a background check. All government positions require some kind of background check. Most positions at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.


The questionnaire you'll need to fill out is called [e-QIP](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/). The questions cover seven years worth of employment and location history, among other things. It may take substantial time to collect contact information for previous employers, as well as old addresses. The e-QIP questionnaire is basically a web version of the [SF-85p](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf). This form includes all the questions you'll be asked so you can use it to get a head start.
