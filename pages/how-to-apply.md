18F and the U.S. Digital Service are distinct groups working toward the same goals. 18F is a digital consultancy within the General Services Administration (GSA). We develop products for other agencies, and those agencies pay for our services. In contrast, the U.S. Digital Service is headquartered inside the Office of Management and Budget. They support and coordinate the work of various digital service teams housed in agencies across the federal government.

If you want to apply <b>directly to 18F</b> please email [join18f@gsa.gov](mailto:join18f@gsa.gov). We don’t require a formal cover letter, but let us know more about you:

* Send PDF version of your current resume 
* Link to your GitHub profile, design portfolio, or attach a writing sample
* Specify what role you’d like to be considered for. Check out our openings [here](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/)
* If you're a veteran, please mention that in your email so we can give you priority consideration
* Don't see an opening that suits you? Tell us what you want to do!

If you want to be considered for the full U.S. Digital Service family and other agencies — submit your application on the [USDS website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service/apply). Enter "join18F" as the referral code. Because you’ll be applying to multiple agencies, application review will take longer than if you apply directly to 18F.

## Additional documents required for GSA hiring process

After you’ve passed through the 18F [interview
phase](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/interview-process/), we will
need some additional documents before your application can be processed
by the GSA. We will let you know when we need each of these documents,
but it’s not a bad idea to start to pull these together in advance
because some of them take time to complete. All documents should be
submitted as a PDF to your point of contact on the 18F talent team.

-   **Professional references:** Three professional references (names, titles, and email addresses).
-   **A current, government-style resume:** This is different from the resume you may have already sent us and is used primarily by the GSA Human Resources (HR) Department to determine your General Schedule position (and therefore salary). Government-style resumes are very different from private-sector resumes. [Here is a guide](http://gogovernment.org/how_to_apply/write_your_federal_resume/create_your_resume.php) and some [example](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM279014.pdf) [resumes](http://www.jobs.irs.gov/downloads/ResumeTips.pdf). In general, it’s best to over explain and to include everything and the kitchen sink.

-   **Salary and compensation**
    -   W2s for the last two years, if available
    -   Any 1099s you may have for that same time frame
    -   Any recent competing offer letters
    -   Your salary expectation

-   **Security clearance**
    -   [OF306 —- Declaration for Federal Employment](https://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of0306.pdf)
    -   [GSA 3665 —- Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action?mediaId=29769)

These documents will be complied by the 18F hiring team and sent to the
GSA HR department.

## Hiring process

After GSA HR receives your documents, you will move to the offer stage
of the process. Here is how that works:

### Tentative offer

1.  18F submits our salary recommendation to HR.
2.  HR reviews our recommendation and makes a tentative offer to you.

If you accept the tentative offer then we will move on to the following
steps.

### Official offer

1.  You receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to have your fingerprints taken. [See fingerprint locations here](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx).
2.  You schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
3.  Fingerprints are sent to GSA by USAccess.
4.  GSA grants you an interim security clearance.
5.  18F sends you a final offer.
6.  We work with you to set a start date. Candidates start every other Monday, which coincides with the start of the GSA pay period.

### Security clearance


If you're selected for hire and accept your offer, you'll need to complete a background check. All government positions require some kind of background check. Most positions at 18F require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but GSA's human resources team will guide you through it.


The questionnaire you'll need to fill out is called [e-QIP](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/). The questions cover seven years worth of employment and location history, among other things. It may take substantial time to collect contact information for previous employers, as well as old addresses. The e-QIP questionnaire is basically a web version of the [SF-86](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf). This form includes all the questions you'll be asked so you can use it to get a head start.
