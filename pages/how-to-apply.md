18F and the U.S. Digital Service are distinct groups working toward the same goals. 18F is a digital consultancy within the General Services Administration.  We develop products for other agencies, and those agencies pay for our services. In contrast, the U.S. Digital Service is headquartered inside the Office of Management and Budget. They support and coordinate the work of various digital service teams housed in agencies across the federal government.

If you want to apply <b>directly to 18F</b> please email join18F@gsa.gov. We don’t require a formal cover letter, but let us know more about you: 

* Link to your GitHub profile, design portfolio, or attach a writing sample
* Specify what role you’d like to be considered for. Check out our openings [here](https://pages.18f.gov/joining-18f/who-we-are-hiring/)
* Don't see an opening that suits you? Tells us what you want to do! 

If you want to be considered for the full U.S. Digital Service family and other agencies —  submit your application on the [USDS website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service/apply). Enter "join18F" as the referral code. Because you’ll be applying to multiple agencies, application review will take longer than if you apply directly to 18F.
