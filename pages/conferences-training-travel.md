### What is the policy on public speaking?

We encourage all 18F team members to spread the love, and are delighted when folks are asked to present at events. We are still getting used to the processes involved in making engagements like this happen (a bit of paperwork), but they are totally doable and most times it will not require you to take personal time.

### What is the policy on travel?

We do have a budget for travel, but we have to be really careful how we spend that money. Therefore, we only have the ability to approve mission-oriented travel when it pertains to client meetings, workshops, some conferences, or certain project-related events(often the client is ultimately paying for the travel).
