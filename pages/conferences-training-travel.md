### What is the policy on public speaking?

We encourage all 18F team members to spread the love and are delighted when folks are asked to present at events. We're still getting used to the processes involved in making engagements like this happen (a bit of paperwork), but they are totally doable and most times do not require you to take personal time.

### What is the policy on travel?

We have a budget for travel, but we have to be really careful how we spend that money. Ultimately the client often pays, and therefore we can only approve mission-oriented travel when it pertains to client meetings, workshops, some conferences, or certain project-related events.
