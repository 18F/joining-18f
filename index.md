## Mission

18F is a civic consultancy _for_ the government, _inside_ the government, working with agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use, cost efficient, and reusable. Our goal is to change how the government buys and develops digital services by helping agencies adopt modern techniques that deliver superior products.  

We are transforming government from the inside out, creating **cultural change** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public. 

We are a **trusted partner** for agencies working to transform how they build and buy tools and services in a user-centered way.

We will accomplish our mission by:

* putting the needs of the public first
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
* deploying tools and services early and often
